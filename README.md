# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The main purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for the Pewlett-Hackard Company. Two tables had to be created to discover this information. Some included information in the first table are employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.

## Results
                        Retirement Count Per Title

From images above, certain points can be highlighted.
* Almost one third of the retirees are Senior Engineers, while another third includes the rest of the Senior Staff. 
* As a result of the query, the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions have the greatest priority when it comes to deciding which roles the company would have to fill. 
* Among the employees that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the company's mentorship program. 
* There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors, and the categories per title for the mentorship progam shows Technical Leader and Assistant Engineer positions must be looked at. This means that the company would have to create an efficient program that can cover the disparity between the number of people retiring and the number of people who can be trained to fill these positions.

## Summary
To determine how many roles need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, a data visualization can be made to categorize the retirees into age groups. For each year, the company can hire (internally or externally) the amount of people that would be retiring, taking into consideration the retiring age is at 65. Currently, there is a list of people who were born between 1952 and 1955. Therefore, there would be a different hiring quota for each of the following four years.

Looking at the current projection of potential mentors and the amount of people retiring, as well as the various categories per title, there are not enough retirees to mentor the next group of employees. Moving forward, a query can be created that gives a list of people who are retiring at the end of the current year (and for each following year). From there, the company can prioritize how many younger employees need to be trained to fill up the retired positions or if not even hired. With this information, the company can plan the mentorship program, specifically, how many mentees a mentor can take on to fulfill the retired roles or should be hired.
